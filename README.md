## LNMIIT-Login-Extension

When you start the extension for the first time after installation, enter your login credentials inside the extension and hit Save button. Your details will be saved locally in the browser storage. When you reopen the extension next time, you won't need to enter your details again. They will already be there. Then all you have to do is open the college LogIn portal and hit Login button and you will be logged in with the provided username and password. This is particularly useful for Chrome/Chromium users since you can not save password for LogIn portal and you have to type it out everytime.
